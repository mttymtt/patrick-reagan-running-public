In 2016, Reagan had a fantastic rookie year of ultrarunning. He finished his year with two international podium finishes: 3rd place finish at the UltraVasan 90K in Mora, Sweden and 3rd at the IAU 100K World Championships in Los Alcazares, Spain. This past year, Reagan debuted at the Comrades Marathon as the top American male with a 12th place finish. He raced to the 6th fastest time by an American in the race's history (Up or Down). In August, Reagan improved his 2016 placement and time at the Ultravasan 90K (6:08.48, 2nd place). In his debut at the 100 Mile distance, Reagan won the Javelina Jundred 100 Mile Endurance run and bested the course record by 29 minutes.
