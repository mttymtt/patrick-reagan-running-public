    Randy was born, raised and currently lives in Kansas City Missouri with his wife Briana and their three children: Leila, Levi and Lincoln. He attended the University of Central Missouri, and although nearly graduated as a physical education major he switched at the last second and finished with a BS in Business Management. Through high school and college Randy was a dedicated wrestler which led to his love for sport, training and coaching. Post college he has coached wrestling at many different levels for 10+ years and knows he wants coaching to be a part of his life for the long haul.

    Randy came to running a bit later in life as he was looking for something to re-dedicate his own fitness journey to. Thinking he would be a one and done marathon runner he quickly fell in love with distance, challenging himself and the running community. This led to a quick progression into the ultra distances where he has been a top 10 finisher at Javelina 100 twice (2020 and 2021), put down a 3:35 50k PB, a 6:07 50 mile PB and has ran many other marathons and ultras. Combining his love for coaching and running has been a natural progression and something that is truly a dream job!

    Randy works as a custom fabricator and run coach but also enjoys cooking, traveling, camping, rock climbing and pretty much anything else he can do outdoors with his family.

    Will is a performance-focused nutritionist, specializing in working with runners to help them increase their performance potential, improve their recovery, and remain injury-free (as best as possible). Optimizing nutrition takes time and habits need to form, so Will guides his clients through a process he designed that helps to work in nutrition changes on a weekly basis and is meant to sustain the nutrition work that is taking place.

    A runner himself, Will speaks the language and understands the drive, barriers, and the nutritional demands and needs of runners. He works with elite runners (including some of the top names in pro ultrarunning), those who are training for their first endurance race, and everyone in between. In other words, whether you are a front-pack runner, mid-pack runner, or back-of-the-pack finisher, your nutrition matters all the same and Will can help you optimize so you can get to that start line as well as that finish line.

    Will is a relatively new father and is loving life in Portland, Oregon with his fancy doctor wife, his two dogs, two cats, and plenty of doug firs. When he's not running or working with clients, he is playing soccer, hiking, attending local plays, or Facetiming with the rest of his family in New Jersey.
