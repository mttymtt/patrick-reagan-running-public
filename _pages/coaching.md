    Kris is a professional ultra runner for HOKA and rabbit with world class performances ranging from 50k to 100 miles on both trails and road. An athlete who prides himself on his versatility, he can often be found racing local 5ks, uphill races, downhill races, and the occasional beer mile. He also spent two years as a professional obstacle course racer, but that's another story.

    A former NCAA Division III runner, Kris's coaching style is rooted in his experience as a collegiate athlete, but accented heavily by the more free-form training style typical of ultrarunners. He has helped numerous runners finish their first ultras, and has coached athletes to PRs at just about every distance.

    Kris and Pat share a love of obscure and sometimes pretty extreme music, and while he tries not to be pretentious about it, he's also pretty knowledgeable about wine, beer, and fine dining. In fact, he used to own a restaurant, and insanely enough, despite that failure he still dreams of opening another one.

    Will is a performance-focused nutritionist, specializing in working with runners to help them increase their performance potential, improve their recovery, and remain injury-free (as best as possible). Optimizing nutrition takes time and habits need to form, so Will guides his clients through a process he designed that helps to work in nutrition changes on a weekly basis and is meant to sustain the nutrition work that is taking place.

    A runner himself, Will speaks the language and understands the drive, barriers, and the nutritional demands and needs of runners. He works with elite runners (including some of the top names in pro ultrarunning), those who are training for their first endurance race, and everyone in between. In other words, whether you are a front-pack runner, mid-pack runner, or back-of-the-pack finisher, your nutrition matters all the same and Will can help you optimize so you can get to that start line as well as that finish line.

    Will is a relatively new father and is loving life in Portland, Oregon with his fancy doctor wife, his two dogs, two cats, and plenty of doug firs. When he's not running or working with clients, he is playing soccer, hiking, attending local plays, or Facetiming with the rest of his family in New Jersey.
